## Python Glossary

#### argument
A value given to a function or program when it runs. The term is often used interchangeably (and inconsistently) with [parameter](#parameter).

#### attribute
A variable that belongs to a particular [class](#class) or a particular [instance](#instance).

#### assign
To give a value a name by associating a variable with it.

#### boolean operators
logical operators, i.e. `and`, `or`, and `not`, that allow us to build more complex conditional statements from simpler conditional statements. See: [conditional statements](#conditional-statement)

#### case-insensitive
Treating text as if upper and lower case characters of the same letter were the same. See also: [case-sensitive](#case-sensitive).

#### case-sensitive
Treating text as if upper and lower case characters of the same letter are different. See also: [case-insensitive](#case-insensitive).

#### comment
A remark in a program that is intended to help human readers understand what is going on, but is ignored by the computer. Comments in Python, R, and the Unix shell start with a `#` character and run to the end of the line; comments in SQL start with `--`, and other languages have other conventions.

#### comma-separated values
(CSV) A common textual representation for tables in which the values in each row are separated by commas.

#### default value
A value to use for a [parameter](#parameter) if nothing is specified explicitly.

#### defensive programming
The practice of writing programs that check their own operation to catch errors as early as possible.

#### docstring
Short for "documentation string", this refers to textual documentation embedded in Python programs. Unlike comments, docstrings are preserved in the running program and can be examined in interactive sessions.

#### documentation
Human-language text written to explain what software does, how it works, or how to use it.

#### dotted notation
A two-part notation used in many programming languages in which `thing.component` refers to the `component` belonging to `thing`.

#### floating-point number
A number containing a fractional part and an exponent. See also: [integer](#integer).

#### function call
A use of a function in another piece of software.

#### immutable
Unchangeable. The value of immutable data cannot be altered after it has been created. See also: [mutable](#mutable).

#### import
To load a [library](#library) into a program.

#### integer
A whole number, such as -12343. See also: [floating-point number](#floating-point-number).

#### library
A family of code units (functions, classes, variables) that implement a set of related tasks. Sometimes referred to as a "package".

#### method
A function which is tied to a particular [object](#object). Each of an object's methods typically implements one of the things it can do, or one of the questions it can answer.

#### mutable
Changeable. The value of mutable data can be altered after it has been created. See also: [immutable](#immutable).

#### parameter
A variable named in the function's declaration that is used to hold a value passed into the call. The term is often used interchangeably (and inconsistently) with [argument](#argument).

#### sequence
A collection of information that is presented in a specific order. For example, in Python, a [string](#string) is a sequence of characters,
while a list is a sequence of any variable.

#### slice
A regular subsequence of a larger sequence, such as the first five elements or every second element.

#### string
Short for "character string", a [sequence](#sequence) of zero or more characters.

#### syntax error
A programming error that occurs when statements are in an order or contain characters not expected by the programming language.

#### traceback
The sequence of function calls that led to an error.

#### type
The classification of something in a program (for example, the contents of a variable) as a kind of number (e.g. [floating-point](#float), [integer](#integer)), [string](#string), or something else.

#### type of error
Indicates the nature of an error in a program. For example, in Python, an `IOError` to problems with file input/output. See also: [syntax error](#syntax-error).

#### variable
A symbolic name that is a reference or pointer to a data object.

#### whitespace
Any character or series of characters that represent horizontal or vertical space. Generally, space-bar, tab, return/enter. Some whitespace in python is represented differently than what you see. A return is `\n` and tab `\t`.
