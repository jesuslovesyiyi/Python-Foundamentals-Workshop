# Python-Fundamentals-Workshop

## Workshop Goals

This interactive workshop is your complete introduction to programming Python for people with little or no previous programming experience, with a focus on data science applications. It covers the basics of Python and Jupyter, variables and data types, and a gentle introduction to data analysis in Pandas.

## Learning Objectives

After completing Python Fundamentals, you will be able to:
- Navigate Jupyter Notebooks.
- Assign variables.
- Distinguish common data types and structures.
- Apply methods to data types.
- Perform basic operations in Pandas.
- Inspect documentation to deal with error messages.

## Workshop Structure

1. **Part 1: Introduction to Jupyter and Python**
2. **Part 2: Data Types and Structures**
3. **Part 3: Introduction to Pandas**

## Installation Instructions

Anaconda is software that allows you to run Python and Jupyter notebooks on your computer. Installing Anaconda is the easiest way to make sure you have all the necessary software to run the materials for this workshop. Complete the following steps:

1. [Download and install Anaconda (Python 3.9 distribution)](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). Click "Download" and then click 64-bit "Graphical Installer" for your current operating system.

2. Download the materials in this repository:

* Click the green "Code" button in the top right of the repository information.
* Click "Download Zip".
* Extract this file to a folder on your computer where you can easily access it (I recommend Desktop).

3. Optional: if you're familiar with `git`, you can instead clone this repository by opening a terminal and entering `git clone https://github.com/jesuslovesyiyi/Python-Fundamentals-Workshop.git`.

## Run the code

Now that you have all the required software and materials, you need to run the code:

1. Open the Anaconda Navigator application. You should see the green snake logo appear on your screen. Note that this can take a few minutes to load up the first time.

2. Click the "Launch" button under "Jupyter Lab" and navigate through your file system to the `Python-Fundamentals-Workshop` folder you downloaded above.

3. Navigate to lessons -> Fundamentals-I

4. Open the `01_Jupyter_and_Python.ipynb` to begin.

5. Press Shift + Enter (or Ctrl + Enter) to run a cell.

The materials of this workshop were first developed by the Berkeley Dlab. I made modifications to the original code to suit the purpose of this course.
